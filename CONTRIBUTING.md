## Development Process

Please consider the following guidelines:
### 1.  Clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:Raise-the-Voices/marturia.git

### 2.  Set up your development environment

### 3.  Make your changes in a new git branch:

    Following this Git branch naming conventions:

        1-) bugfix/description
        2-) features/feature-name

### 4.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message:
    
    Following this commit message conventions:

      The header is mandatory.

      - Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 72 characters!
      - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
      - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
      - No dot (.) at the end
      - Don't capitalize the first letter

      Samples:

      docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
      fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

      Type

      - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)

      - docs: Documentation only changes
      - feat: A new feature
      - fix: A bug fix
      - perf: A code change that improves performance
      - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

### 5.  Submit a pull request with your changes and request a code review from at least two(2) members
